# Active Context: Chatsidian

*This file tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions. Initialized at the start of the project.*

## Current Work Focus

-   **Project Initiation**: Setting up the initial project structure and development environment as defined in Phase 1, Microphase 1.1.
-   **Memory Bank Setup**: Populating the initial Memory Bank (`cline_docs`) based on existing project documentation (`ProjectReadme.md`, `1_Architecture/Overview.md`, `3_Implementation/Phase1-Microphases.md`).

## Recent Changes

-   Created the core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
-   Populated Memory Bank files with initial information derived from project documentation.

## Next Steps

1.  **Complete Memory Bank Initialization**: Populate `progress.md`.
2.  **Create `.clinerules`**: Initialize the project intelligence file.
3.  **Begin Microphase 1.1**: Start implementing the tasks outlined in `3_Implementation/Phase1.1-Project-Setup.md`, beginning with initializing the project repository and setting up `package.json`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

-   Confirming the plan to follow the microphases outlined in `3_Implementation/Phase1-Microphases.md`.
-   Establishing the core Memory Bank structure as the foundation for ongoing documentation.
