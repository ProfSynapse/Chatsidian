## In Progress

### Phase 4: Documentation & Polish
- ⏳ User documentation
- ⏳ Developer documentation
- ⏳ Performance optimization
- ⏳ Final testing and bug fixes
- ⏳ Release preparation

## Known Issues

- Integration tests are passing, but they rely on mock implementations that may not fully represent the real Obsidian environment.
- The folder nesting implementation may need additional testing with deep hierarchies to ensure proper rendering.
- Drag-and-drop functionality may need additional error handling for edge cases.
- There's an issue with the SearchBar component in the ChatView tests where `obsidian_1.TextComponent is not a constructor`. This doesn't affect the ConversationList tests but should be addressed before proceeding to the next phase.

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 4: Documentation & Polish
   - Create user documentation
   - Create developer documentation
   - Optimize performance
   - Conduct final testing and fix bugs
   - Prepare for release
