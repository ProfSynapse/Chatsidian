# Microphase Review Checklist

This checklist provides a systematic approach for reviewing each Chatsidian microphase to ensure optimal alignment with Obsidian's native capabilities.

## Initial Review
- [ ] Read the complete microphase documentation
- [ ] Identify key components and functionality being implemented
- [ ] Note the design patterns and architectural approach

## Obsidian API Research
- [ ] Review Obsidian's official documentation for relevant APIs
  - [ ] Check Plugin API documentation
  - [ ] Examine related class documentation (Vault, FileManager, etc.)
  - [ ] Look for examples of similar functionality in Obsidian
- [ ] Search for additional resources if official documentation is lacking
- [ ] Document relevant Obsidian classes and methods that could be leveraged

## Alignment Analysis
- [ ] Identify areas where custom implementations duplicate Obsidian functionality
- [ ] Evaluate performance implications of the current implementation
- [ ] Consider maintenance overhead of custom implementations
- [ ] Look for opportunities to follow Obsidian's design patterns
- [ ] Check if implementation follows Obsidian's lifecycle management

## Recommendation Formulation
- [ ] Create specific, actionable recommendations for each identified issue
- [ ] Provide concrete code examples showing preferred implementation
- [ ] Explain the benefits of each recommendation:
  - [ ] Improved alignment with Obsidian
  - [ ] Reduced code complexity
  - [ ] Enhanced performance
  - [ ] Better maintainability
  - [ ] More intuitive user experience

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Prioritize recommendations by impact and complexity
- [ ] Outline a step-by-step implementation plan
- [ ] Note any potential backwards compatibility issues
- [ ] Identify any dependencies on other microphases

## Documentation
- [ ] Document recommendations for future reference
- [ ] Create specific examples of Obsidian-aligned implementations
- [ ] Record rationale for alignment decisions

## Follow-up
- [ ] Track which recommendations were implemented
- [ ] Note any challenges encountered during implementation
- [ ] Document lessons learned for future microphases
