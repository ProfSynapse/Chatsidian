- For paletteCommander I think maybe it just skips the list and just as part of the execution schema we interpolate all commands
- Need create a separate doc for phase 2 related to each BCP agent and make it review the claudesidian implementation for guidance
  - need to make sure we have in the messages a tool use animation/accordion similar to claudes
  - we probably want to create an obsidian facade to abstract all the obsidian operations
