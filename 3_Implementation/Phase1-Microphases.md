# Phase 1 Microphases: Core Infrastructure

This document outlines the microphases for implementing the core infrastructure of the Chatsidian plugin, breaking down the larger Phase 1 into more manageable and actionable steps.

## Microphase 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

**Objective**: Set up the basic project structure and development environment for the Chatsidian plugin.

**Tasks**:
1. Initialize project repository
2. Configure build system with esbuild
3. Set up TypeScript configuration
4. Create basic plugin boilerplate
5. Configure testing environment with Jest
6. Create project documentation structure

**Key Files**:
- `package.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `esbuild.config.mjs`
- `manifest.json`
- Project README and documentation

**Expected Outcome**: A functioning plugin development environment where code can be written, built, and tested.

## Microphase 1.2: Data Models and TypeScript Interfaces

**Objective**: Define the core data models and TypeScript interfaces for the plugin.

**Tasks**:
1. Create conversation and message models
2. Define provider-related interfaces
3. Create settings model with default values
4. Document model relationships and usage patterns
5. Write unit tests for models

**Key Files**:
- `src/models/Conversation.ts`
- `src/models/Provider.ts`
- `src/models/Settings.ts`
- Tests for models

**Expected Outcome**: Well-defined TypeScript interfaces that provide type safety and documentation for the plugin's data structures.

## Microphase 1.3: Event Bus Implementation

**Objective**: Create the event system for component communication.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement event bus core functionality
2. Add support for async event handlers
3. Create event types and documentation
4. Add handling for errors in event callbacks
5. Write unit tests for event bus

**Key Files**:
- `src/core/EventBus.ts`
- Tests for event bus

**Expected Outcome**: A robust event system that allows plugin components to communicate in a decoupled manner.

## Microphase 1.4: Settings Management

**Objective**: Implement settings management with secure API key storage.

**Tasks**:
1. Create settings manager class
2. Implement settings persistence methods
3. Create settings UI components
4. Add secure API key handling
5. Set up settings change event propagation
6. Write tests for settings functionality

**Key Files**:
- `src/core/SettingsManager.ts`
- Settings UI components
- Tests for settings management

**Expected Outcome**: A settings system that allows users to configure the plugin and securely store API keys.

## Microphase 1.5: Storage Abstractions

**Objective**: Develop storage abstractions for Obsidian vault interaction.

**Tasks**:
1. Create storage manager class
2. Implement conversation persistence
3. Add methods for loading, saving, and managing conversations
4. Implement folder management
5. Set up caching for improved performance
6. Write tests for storage functionality

**Key Files**:
- `src/core/StorageManager.ts`
- Tests for storage

**Expected Outcome**: A storage system that handles persisting data to the Obsidian vault, manages folders, and provides efficient data access.

## Microphase 1.6: Provider Adapters

**Objective**: Build the provider adapter pattern for AI API connections.

**Tasks**:
1. Create provider adapter interface
2. Implement Anthropic adapter
3. Create adapter factory
4. Add support for streaming responses
5. Implement error handling
6. Write tests for provider adapters

**Key Files**:
- `src/providers/ProviderAdapter.ts`
- `src/providers/AnthropicAdapter.ts`
- `src/providers/ProviderFactory.ts`
- Other provider adapters
- Tests for provider adapters

**Expected Outcome**: A flexible system for connecting to different AI services with unified interfaces and robust error handling.

## Microphase 1.7: Plugin Lifecycle Management

**Objective**: Establish the plugin's lifecycle management.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement main plugin class
2. Set up plugin initialization and cleanup
3. Connect core components (settings, storage, providers)
4. Add command registration
5. Configure plugin loading/unloading
6. Write integration tests

**Key Files**:
- `src/main.ts`
- Integration tests

**Expected Outcome**: A fully functional plugin infrastructure that correctly handles initialization, cleanup, and component coordination.

## Implementation Timeline

| Microphase | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1.1 Project Setup | 1-2 days | None |
| 1.2 Data Models | 2-3 days | 1.1 |
| 1.3 Event Bus | 1-2 days | 1.1 |
| 1.4 Settings Management | 2-3 days | 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 |
| 1.5 Storage Abstractions | 3-4 days | 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 |
| 1.6 Provider Adapters | 3-4 days | 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 |
| 1.7 Plugin Lifecycle | 2-3 days | 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 |

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Manual testing in Obsidian development environment
- Mock Obsidian API for automated testing

## Next Steps After Completion

After completing all microphases of Phase 1, the project will have a solid foundation for Phase 2, which focuses on implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) client and Bounded Context Pack (BCP) architecture.
