# Phase 3.5: Sidebar and Organization

## Overview

This microphase focuses on creating a sidebar for browsing and organizing conversations in the Chatsidian plugin. The sidebar provides a more comprehensive view of all conversations compared to the dropdown selector, with additional organization features like folders, starring, and drag-and-drop reordering.

The sidebar will be collapsible to maximize space for the chat interface when needed, while providing powerful organization tools when expanded. It will integrate with the StorageManager from Phase 1 to persist organization changes.
